RAODEN’S TELEPORTATION
	<br/>I had to work very hard to make this one work.  I think it turned out, but it is a little bit of a stretch.  Hopefully, readers will go with me on this one because of the climactic feeling of the near-ending.
	<br/><br/>Regardless, I do think I gave Raoden all the pieces he needed here.  Adien always existed in the book for this one moment—to give Raoden the length measurement he needed to go try to save Sarene.  I’ve established that Seons have perfect senses of direction, and I’ve talked about how to use Aon Tia.  More importantly, I think I’ve established that this is something that Raoden would do.  He gets just a shade foolhardy when Sarene is concerned.  (It’s all her fault.)
	<br/><br/>There is another important element to this teleportation.  I thought it important to involve deity in the climax of what has been such an overtly religious book.  You may not believe in God, and it is never my intention to belittle your choices.  However, the format of this book has been one that dealt with religion and the way that people interact with their faith.  And so, I took this last moment of the book, and gave Raoden an opportunity to call upon the aid of providence.  
	<br/><br/>Raoden arrives safely, despite the odds against his having gotten the distance, direction, and other factors right.  You are free to simply think of this as luck, if you wish.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS<br/>
	Now, I’d just like to note here that Raoden’s just returning a favor.  Sarene is the one who gave him the clue that led to his fixing the Aons, then finally restoring Elantris.  Now that she’s in danger, he gets to rescue her in turn.  Just because someone finds themselves in danger or trouble does not mean that they themselves aren’t competent.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
WEAK AONS<br/>
	Elantris is like a massive power conduit.  It focuses the Dor, strengthening its power (or, rather, the power of the Aons to release it) in Arelon.  This far away from Elantris, however, the Aons are about as powerful as they were before Raoden fixed Elantris.  
	<br/><br/>If you consider it, it makes logical sense that the Aons would be tied to ELANTRIS and Arelon, yet would work without them.  The Aons had to exist before Elantris—otherwise, the original Elantrians wouldn’t have known the shape to make the city.  Their study of AonDor taught them a method for amplifying Aon power.
