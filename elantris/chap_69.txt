<div class="article_content">Chapter Fifty-Eight—part one
<br/><br/>
	At least you can’t say that I didn’t warn you about the Avalanche.

	Okay, so I’m a prude.  I’ll admit that.  I like my characters to be married before they have sex.  Besides, Sarene is right—she deserves a wedding.  She’s waited since chapter two to have her big, princess’s wedding.  She deserves something official.  So, Raoden and Sarene spend this night apart.  Besides assuaging my moral sense of decency, it works much better for the plot to have them apart.
<br/><br/>
	Notice that Raoden awakes here, much in the same way that he did in chapter one.  I kind of wanted this chapter to call back to that one.  Both chapters open with a slight sense of peace, followed by awful discovery.  Both end with Raoden being cast into hell.

	My only sadness concerning the Dakhor is that I had to wait so long to reveal them.  I think that visually, they are very interesting.  The concept of a group whose bones have been twisted and deformed by powerful magics brings interesting images to mind.  
<br/><br/>	The Dakhor aren’t majorly deformed, however—they still have all the pieces in the right places.  Their bones have simply been. . .changed.  Expanded in places, simply twisted to form patterns in others.  Because of this, of course, they have to run around shirtless.  It’s more dramatic that way.  Besides, we spent all this money on special effects—we might as well show them off.
<br/><br/>	Of all the things in the book, this one worries the most with its sudden appearance.  I really did try to foreshadow this as best I could.  If it’s still too sudden for you, I apologize.  My suggestion is to just sit back and enjoy the ride.
