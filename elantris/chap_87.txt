	This is the dénouement to the denouement, I guess.  We get to end with my favorite character, tying up some of the small loose ends that were related to her storyline.  There is some good material here—she points out that Raoden is doing well as king, how Ahan is fairing, and gives a nice prognosis for the future of Arelon.
<br/><br/>	However, the important part of the epilogue comes at the end.  I love the last line of the book, despite the fact that Joshua disagrees with it.  (He wanted something else there—I can’t quite remember now what his quibble was.)
	<br/><br/>Anyway, I always intended to end this book talking about Hrathen.  He was their savior, after a manner—and he certainly was a dominant force in the book.  I wanted to give him one final send-off—to honor him for what he did, both for Arelon, and for the story in general.
