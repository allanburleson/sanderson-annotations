HRATHEN’S DECISION
	<br/>As I’ve mentioned, Hrathen has the most progression of any of the characters in this book.  It’s fitting, therefore, that he should get the best character climax.  
	<br/><br/>Essentially, ELANTRIS—at least Hrathen’s third of it—is a redemption story.  It is the story of Hrathen trying to make up for the massacre he caused in Duladel.  Beyond that, it’s the story of a man struggling to understand what faith is, and what that faith requires of him.  In the end, his decision to save Sarene comes as a rejection of the sins of his past.  And, in a slight way, it is a rejection of the heartless, logical man he assumed himself to be.

THE POOL
	<br/>So, this is a SLIGHTLY contrived mechanic, and I realize that.  I let Raoden off easily by having him simply choose not to be dissolved by the pool.
	<br/><br/>Partially, I did this simply because I couldn’t think of a better way to get him out of it.  In addition, however, I think it fits the form of the novel.  The pool represents giving in—though it’s giving in to peace instead of pain, it is still an admittance of defeat.  I’ve mentioned over and over that the pain has no power against one who doesn’t give in to it.  I don’t see why the peace should be any different.  If you can resist one, then you can resist the other.
	<br/><br/>Besides, the image of Raoden bursting from the pool in front of Galladon and Karata was too good to pass up.
	<br/><br/>I’m honestly not sure what the pool is or how exactly it fits into the theory of this magic system.  It was added as a plotting devise, as mentioned earlier, and therefore was never tied directly to the cosmology or theoretics of the world.  When I do a sequel to this book, I think I’ll try and find a way to tie it in.  For now, however, it’s kind of a loose thread.  The only thing I know for certain is what I mentioned above.  Just like the pain of an Elantrian, I think the peace offered by this pool is a supernatural force.  It has something to do with the physical form of the Elantrians.
