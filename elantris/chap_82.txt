HRATHEN AND SARENE (Hidden text below.)
	<br/>There is some good, if terse, exposition here with Hrathen sorting through his feelings.  I don’t think he really wants to come to any answers right now.  Logic has lead him astray before, and now that he’s doing what he feels is right, he doesn’t want to pause to give himself a chance to consider the ramifications of what he’s done.
	<br/><br/>Again, Sarene has fulfilled her purpose in the book.  She’s thrown chaos into Hrathen’s otherwise-orderly life.  However, her chaos here—just like the chaos she caused in Elantris with her food—eventually proves to be a good thing.  It inspires change for the better, even though that change is painful.   
	<br/><br/><div id="spoiler0" style="color:red;">And, of course, I remind the reader here that there is something odd about Hrathen’s arm.  I’ve only mentioned it in a couple of places, so I don’t expect people to remember what is going on here.   I actually forgot to have the sleeve in the original rewrite.  I didn’t even think to notice that his Dakhor arm would be exposed to Sarene in this scene. . . .</div>

EDITS 
	<br/>I keep promising that I’ll tell you about some of the other silly character revelations I had pop up in the book.  This one is particularly embarrassing.  To be honest, I have NO idea what I was thinking.  
	<br/><br/>In the original draft of the book, Hrathen turns out to have been from Duladel the entire time.  It’s revealed in this scene, when he and Sarene are running from the Dakhor.  He was of Dula blood, having grown up there, then moved to Fjorden as a teenager.
	<br/><br/>Yes, I know.  I must have been tired when I wrote that chapter.  Anyway, at one point it must have seemed like a good idea.  It didn’t make even the first cut, however—my first readers rose up in open rebellion, and I joined them.
	<br/><br/>I figure I must have decided that it was more dramatic to discover that Hrathen had betrayed his own people by destroying Duladel.  (Note, in the early draft of the book, I made more of a habit of pointing out that the Duladen republicans weren’t generally dark-skinned.)  In the first draft, I always had Hrathen wear black die in his hair and pretended to be from Fjorden.
	<br/><br/>Yes, again, I know.  It was stupid.  We writers do stupid things sometimes.  I didn’t even pause to think that the drama of Hrathen betraying his own people and religion in the present is far more powerful than a betrayal that happened before the book even started.  I denied his entire character by trying to rely on some whim that seemed like a clever, unexpected twist.  Don’t let yourselves do things like this, writers.  Let the twists help develop the character, not exist simply to surprise.
	<br/><br/>Anyway, I’ll post this scene in the deleted scenes section.  It’ll keep me humble to know people can read it.

THE SALVATION OF ELANTRIS
	<br/>Yes, Raoden lets the Dakhor monks go.  That’s the sort of thing that happens in this book.  If you want something more gritty, you can read MISTBORN.  (Which is gritty for me, though nowhere near the genius sadism of George R. R. Martin’s books.)
	<br/><br/>I like having this scene from Lukel’s viewpoint.  If nothing else were gained from his other sections, I think the scene of the Elantrians emerging from the flames would be enough to justify his viewpoints in these last few chapters.  
<br/><br/>	So, anyway, that’s one major plot line finished.  Elantris has been restored.  Most fantasies, however, are about characters more they are about plot.  I love great twists and revelations—but the book isn’t over until the characters are fulfilled.  So, onward.
