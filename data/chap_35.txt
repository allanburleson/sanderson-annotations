<div class="article_content">Chapter Thirty (No Hidden Spoilers.  Sorry!)

<br/><br/>	And, we finally get to figure out what is going on.  As I said, this is one of my favorite triads because of the way it manages to string a cliff-hanger across three separate chapters.  I’ve spoken often of how difficult it was, at times, to maintain the triad structure.  However, scenes like these are the reward.  We get to see from Hrathen’s viewpoint the things spoken off in Sarene’s viewpoint, and often (especially later in the book) we can see the same scene from different sets of eyes, seeing different opinions and thoughts manifest.
<br/><br/>	Another interesting note in this chapter is that we finally get to see what Raoden went through in chapter one.  The washing process isn’t all that exciting, but I have had several people remark that they were sad to have missed it.  I guess that’s just human curiosity.  Well, for those who wondered what the process was, they finally got to see it in this chapter. 
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>	
	Father Omin, by the way, ‘traces Aon Omi’ on Hrathen’s chest as part of the religious service.  This should look familiar.  It is a subtle little thing, but I wanted to show how the Korathi religion has been influenced by its proximity to Elantris.  The priests probably wouldn’t do something like this in Teod.  In a way, Hrathen is right—Elantris has had a corrupting influence on those around it.
<br/><br/>	However, ‘corruption’ is probably too strong a word.  Religions adapt as their people adapt, and often times cultural elements are incorporated into belief structures.  People have asked me, as a Christian, what I think about Christmas itself being set in place of a pagan holiday.  Doesn’t really bother me.  The day we happen to celebrate the birth of Christ doesn’t have any doctrinal importance to me.  A religious person has to be willing, in my mind, to accept that while truth may be eternal, the way we interact with it—as changing human beings—must needs be influenced by the way we think and the way society works. 
<br/><br/>	It doesn’t matter if my religion ‘borrowed’ things from other religions or cultures—especially if the things we filched added good things to the religion.  That’s what humans do.  We adapt.  We steal.  This especially makes sense if you happen to be a writer.  (We’re really good at stealing. . .uh, I mean ‘adapting.’)
