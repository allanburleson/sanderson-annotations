THE DAKHOR MONKS
	<br/><br/>In the original write of the book, the Dakhor broke and ran before the Elantiran attack.  My thought was that the Dakhor always been so much more powerful than their opponents that they didn’t know what to do when faced with someone more powerful than they were.  In a rewrite, however, I changed this.  I’d spent too much time establishing that he Dakhor were fiercely loyal.  I see them as fanatics—people who were either originally like Dilaf, or who became like him through their conditioning.  They wouldn’t break before a superior force—they’d attack it, even if it meant getting slaughtered.
<br/><br/>	This revision works far better for me—especially since I can have the scene where Dilaf wishes he could join them.  Death is not something that scares a group like this.  
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
RAODEN AND SARENE VS DILAF
	<br/><br/>There’s really only one way this battle could have ended—Dilaf had to win.  Raoden might know his Aons, but Dilaf has been a Dakhor for decades.  Sarene has practiced fencing, but Dilaf is a warrior monk with a supernaturally fast and powerful body.  It makes sense to me that this little battle wouldn’t even be much of a contest.  Both Sarene and Raoden are people who succeed not based on their ability to beat up their enemies, but on their ability to manipulate their surroundings.  By having the heroes defeated in combat by the villain at the end, I think I give a final nod to my desire to write a book that didn’t use violence as the solution to problems.
	<br/><br/>(Oh, and if you caught the reference to the word ‘Skaze,’ then good for you.  The Skaze are a group that will appear in the sequel, when and if I get around to writing it.  They’re pretty much evil Seons.)
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
HRATHEN<br/><br/>
	So, Hrathen wasn’t really dead.  (Ironically, while many of you are probably saying ‘yeah, yeah.  That was obvious,’ I actually didn’t have him appear here in the first eight drafts of the book.  I’ll explain later.)
	<br/><br/>I think this is my favorite scene of this chapter.  Not only is it written a little better than the rest of the book (I added it quite late—just this last summer) but it gives final closure to the Hrathen-Dilaf relationship.  It uses Hrathen’s time in Dakhor as an ironic twist against Dilaf.  In short, it is a pretty good scene.  Fulfills character, plot, and theme at the same time—while giving us a nice image to boot.  (Though I do hate to do the “Hey look, a guy we thought was dead is really alive” twist.)
<br/><br/>	The story behind this scene is pretty recent.  One of the original rewrites Moshe asked for was a fix of the ending, which he thought was too Deus Ex Machina.  (Which, indeed, it was.)  I don’t think I’ll go into the entire original version here—it was quite different.  You can read the alternate ending in the deleted scenes section, when I throw it up next month.  The short of it, however, is that Ien (Raoden’s Seon) showed up to save Raoden and Sarene from Dilaf.  I used a mechanic of the magic system that I have since pretty much cut from the novel (since it was only in the book to facilitate this scene) that allowed Ien to complete his Aon, ‘healing’ Dilaf.  Except, since Ien’s Aon was broken, it turned Dilaf into an Elantrian instead.  (A non-glowing Elantrian.  One like Raoden the group used to be—like Dilaf’s own wife became after she was improperly healed in Elantris.)
<br/><br/>	I know that’s probably confusing to you.  The scene, over all, was just kind of weak.  It relied on a barely-explained mechanic mixed with a tangential character showing up at just the right moment.  When Moshe asked for the change, I immediately saw that I needed to bring Hrathen back to life for a few more moments.  Letting him die on the street just wasn’t dignified enough (though originally I wanted him to die this way because it felt more realistic.)  I wanted a final confrontation between Hrathen and Dilaf, since it would give most people’s favorite character a heroic send-off, and would also let me tie in the aforementioned Dakhor irony.  
<br/><br/>	In the end, I was very pleased with the rewrite.  It’s good to have an editor.
