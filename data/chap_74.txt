Chapter Sixty Part One
<br/><br/>
FORM<br/>
	From here on out, the chapters get longer.  It’s interesting to try and work with pacing.  I think the shifting viewpoints achieve the sense of drama I want, and coupling that with lots of new chapters would be repetitive, I think.  So, I waited for the most dramatic moments possible to end chapters.  I think this ending counts.
	<br/><br/>The triad system breaks down completely here.  Everything is falling apart, and we’re getting wild viewpoints from all over the place.  (Well, not exactly—we only add Galladon and Lukel.  However, I think that after fifty-nine chapters with only three viewpoints, suddenly adding two more will be disorienting enough to have the effect I want.)  
	<br/><br/>Part of the reason I add the viewpoints is so that I can show the breakdown of the form of the book.  However, another—perhaps more important—reason is so that I can show what is happening in places that don’t involve one of the three viewpoints.  Raoden is off in his own little world of pain, and Sarene and Hrathen have gone to Teod.  If I want to show what’s happening in Arelon, I need some new viewpoints.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>
GALLADON<br/>
	I like finally having a chance to characterize Galladon internally.  My sense is that you can never really get to know a character until you can see their thoughts.  So, I gave a nice little series of viewpoints to Galladon, partially to show what was happening to Raoden’s body, partially so that I could have some last-minute introspection and philosophizing regarding what is happening in the chapters.
	<br/><br/>Galladon’s hope monologue in this chapter is probably the most powerful, and most interesting, section he gets in the book.  This piece is supposed to mimic what the reader is feeling—things are going terribly, but Raoden has always managed to pull out a miracle.  He may look bad now, but he can still save them.  Can’t he?  
	<br/><br/>I think Galladon is more pessimistic—naturally—than the reader will be.  However, he raises good questions, and his talk about hope—how Raoden’s gift to him is the inability to give up completely—is one final showing of the power Raoden’s personality has in this book. Perhaps the most amazing thing Raoden does in this book—more difficult a task to overcome than the gangs, more rewarding than taking the throne of Arelon—is make a believer out of a man like Galladon.  A man who had given up on hope, but who now continues to believe, even though all is lost.
