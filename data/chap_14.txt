<div class="article_content">Chapter Ten (No Spoilers.  Sorry!)
<br/><br/>
	Are the Elantrians zombies?  I’ve been asked this question before.  The answer is a little bit yes, a little bit no.  I very intentionally don’t make any references in the story to them being zombie-like, and I certainly don’t call them ‘undead.’  Both words bring a lot of baggage with them.  
<br/><br/>	No, the Elantrians aren’t ‘zombies.’  However, they certainly would fit the standard fantasy definition of being ‘undead.’  After all, their bodies aren’t really alive, but they can think.  Still, I resist comparisons to established fantasy traditions.  I wanted the Elantrians to be their own genre of creatures.  In the world I have created, they are simply ‘Elantrians.’  They are people who don’t need to eat, whose bodies only function on a marginal level, and whose pains never go away.  For the function they fill in the world and the story, I’d rather that they be compared to lepers. 
<br/><br/>	That said, I always have wanted to do a story with a zombie as a main character.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>	This chapter introduces a couple of minor characters for Raoden’s gang.  One thing you’ll notice here is the good-natured humor I include in the chapter.  (Or, at least, I hope you found it humorous.)  I had a real worry that ELANTRIS would be too dark a book, considering the things that Raoden has to go through.  That’s why Galladon’s character is so important.  In my mind, Galladon fits the most basic definition of a humorous character—he is a juxtaposition.  He is a pessimist from a culture of optimists.  He is a foil to Raoden, yet at the same time his comedic pessimism lifts the story and points out just how ridiculous their situations are.  
<br/><br/>	Galladon isn’t simply comic relief—I have never used, and never intend to use, a comic-relief character.  However, he allows for some farce and some fun-poking, which in turn lightens the air of what could otherwise be a very gloomy book.  His relationship with Raoden proves that even in the hellpit of Elantris, things like friendship and trust can exist.
<br/><br/>	Because I have three separate storylines in this book, I have to move quickly.  (Or, at least, quickly for me.)  This allowed me to keep up the pacing, and to have a good amount of tension in every chapter.  Of the three viewpoints, however, I think Raoden’s chapters seem to move the quickest, though Hrathen has the smallest number of pages.
