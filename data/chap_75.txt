Chapter Sixty Part Two
<br/><br/>
LUKEL
<br/>	Lukel isn’t as interesting as Galladon, but I still enjoyed giving him a viewpoint.  He has the perfect personality to show what I wanted in these chapters.  He’s not a warrior—like Kinn—or a king—like Raoden.  He’s just a regular person caught in a nightmare.  
<br/><br/>	I wanted to deal a little bit with prisoner mentality in this scene.  People allow terrible things to be done to them in situations like this.  Part of it is because they fear what COULD happen more than they fear what IS happening.  In this case, hope proves their enemy.  The Dakhor stop killing the people and start rounding them up instead.  The reason for this is simple—after seeing and hearing such terrible things, the people would run and fight.  However, if the Dakhor back off, the people can hope that the worst is over.  For this reason, they let themselves get rounded up and gathered in Elantris.
	<br/><br/>It may seem convenient that the soldiers wait to kill the people, but I think it makes sense.  You want to gather everyone in an enclosed place, where they will be trapped, before you begin your slaughter in earnest.  That way you can be certain there are no escapees.  The only one I fudged here was Kiin.  A Dakhor probably should have killed him.  However, I’ve had enough corpses in this book.  Randomly killing off Kiin seemed like too much.  (Some readers are already in rebellion over the people I’ve killed—or, rather, will kill shortly. . . .)
	<br/><br/>Anyway, I get past part of this concern by throwing in the ‘purification rites’ line.  This hints that there is some sort of ritual that needs to be preformed before the people can be killed, and therefore explains why the Dakhor don’t just slaughter them immediately.  (I still think that control is the greater reason, however.)  Another explanation of why the slaughter starts is mentioned by Lukel.  Most of the Derethi left in Arelon are regular soldier-monks, not Dakhor.  They don’t have the same. . .zeal for destruction as Dakhor.

 DILAF’S BACKSTORY
	<br/>I hope that Dilaf’s explanations about his past are suitably creepy.  I also hope they give some explanation.  He is a man who betrayed his religion when he thought it would save the woman he loved—only to find himself, in turn, betrayed by the Elantrians.  His wife became Hoed, and he himself burned her.  This would have something of an effect on a man’s psyche, I think.
	<br/><br/>Now, recall that Elantris was at the height of its power when Dilaf took his wife in to be healed.  I mentioned her earlier in the book, in a Raoden chapter.  He found a story in one of his textbooks about a woman who was improperly-healed, and it turned her into what the Elantrians now are.  This is Dilaf’s wife. (Go re-read Chapter Twenty-Five for the story.)  I find this little item beautifully circular.
	<br/><br/>Anyway, we now have an explanation for Dilaf’s instability and his hatred.  I really like how Dilaf, normatively, grows into being the prime villain for this book.  He comes to it slowly, kind of stealthily, while the reader is focusing on Hrathen.  Yet, Dilaf is there from the first Hrathen chapter, always dangerous, always trying to destroy Elantris, always making his own plans.  I worked hard to bring about his rise to power in the book, and I hope that it worked.  Puling off the Dilaf/Hrathen reversal was one of my main goals in the story.
