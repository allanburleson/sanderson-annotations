<div class="article_content">Chapter twenty-one (Spoilers Hidden)

<br/><br/>
	Some of the most fulfilling experiences in writing this book came from the Hrathen chapters.  Though Joshua still occasionally complains that he finds Hrathens internal monologues to be slow and ponderous, I find them essential to the plot.  Chapters like this—chapters where we really get to see how Hrathen thinks—are what makes this book more than just a nice adventure story.  
	<br/><br/><br/>
	The section where Hrathen tries to appoint a new Head Arteth is a more recent addition to the book.  I wanted to show the power Dilaf was beginning to have over Hrathens work in the city, and thought that this made another nice little sub-conflict for Hrathen to deal with.  
<br/><br/>	The chapter used to begin with Hrathen trying to send Dilaf away.  Though I added some new information at the beginning, that particular scene is pretty much intact from the first draft.  I do worry that some of Hrathen and Dilafs posturings dont come across as well as they could.  This exchange is a wonderful example—I havent had time in the book to do as much explaining about the Derethi religion as I would like.  Because of this, I have to explain Dilafs move as he tries to perform it.  This is always a weaker narrative structure than if the move itself is an obvious outflow from the dynamics of the world.  If readers had understood just what an Odiv and a Krondet were, then all Dilaf would have to do is mention that hed sworn a bunch of Odivs, and the reader would know what he was doing.
<br/><br/>	Even still, I like what happens here.  For the first time, the book expressly shows that Dilaf is planning and working against Hrathen.  Before, hes always been able to fall behind his excuse of, I was caught up in the moment.  This, however, is an obviously planned maneuver intended to give him power over Hrathen.

<div id="spoiler0" style="color:red;">I mention the Outer Cities here with the beggars.  Actually, the main reason I put them in was to give myself another excuse to mention the Outer Cities.  Throughout the books progress, Ive been worried that people wouldnt understand the ending climax.  In order to get what is going on with Aon Rao, they need to understand the geography of the cities around Elantris.  Hopefully, I describe it well enough that it comes off.<br/><br/><br/></div>

	Im very fond of this last scene for two reasons.  First is the fact that I get to show Hrathen being charitable.  He really does care.  When characterizing him in my mind, this scene always jumps out as showing something very important about him.
<br/><br/>	Contrasted with that moment, however, is Omins lucid presentation of Hrathen a hypocrite.  All this time, Hrathen has worked against Shu-Korath, trying to stamp it out.  Yet, in one brief moment, Omin scores a personal hit that is more painful than anything Hrathen could do in return.  
<br/><br/>	Notice how Hrathen keeps trying to pull the discussion away from discussing truth in this scene.  He knows that he can dominate if he can get the conversation to center around logic.  However, truth is something that is hard to define, and something even harder to argue against.  Despite his priestly mantle, he finds truth outside of his authority and experience.
