<div class="article_content">Chapter Eighteen (Spoilers Hidden)
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
	This chapter went through some heavy edits.  First off, I originally had Hrathen interrogate the Elantrian off-stage.  At a suggestion from my editor, I put this in-scene, showing Hrathen talk to the Elantrian.  The intention here was to give a little characterization to Hrathen by showing his logical approach to studying and interrogating his prisoner.
<br/><br/>	The other big change to this chapter came in the middle.  As I was working on the later revisions, I realized—at Joshua’s suggestion—that I really wanted something here in the early middle of the book that showed Hrathen sparring against Dilaf and winning.  In certain sections of the book, Hrathen’s character came off too weakly—and this was one of the chapters.  Originally, I had Dilaf extinguish the torches of his own accord, then burn the Elantrian later, despite Hrathen’s protests.
<br/><br/>	In the new version, I get to have Hrathen prove his competence by having him wrestle control of the crowd.  He is the one who burns the Elantrian, which enhances the scene by letting Hrathen feel guilt for it.  He comes off much stronger in this chapter than he did before. <div id="spoiler0" style="color:red;"> Those of you who have read on realize how important this is to the plot, because from here out, Dilaf starts to get the better of Hrathen.  I needed to reinforce Hrathen’s strength at the beginning of the story, otherwise I feared that the scenes of Dilaf winning would make Hrathen seem too weak.  Hopefully, things now feel like they are balanced—one gaining dominance for a time, then the other wrestling it away, and so on and so forth.</div>
<br/><br/>	You should notice the comments about unity popping up in religious scenes throughout the book.  Omin spoke of it before, and Hrathen often thinks—or mentions—the concept.  When designing the religions of this book, I really wanted them to feel authentic.  If you look at our own world, one thing is obvious (I think) about the way major religions work.  They always fragmented—different sects of the same teachings often rise up and squabble with each other.  Judaism, Islam, and Christianity share obvious links.  In a similar way, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other eastern religions share some common roots.
<br/><br/>	So, in designing the Korathi and Derethi churches, I decided to give them a common ancestor—Shu-Keseg.  All three religions came from the teachings of a single Jindoeese man.  (You might note that the word ‘Shu,’ as used in connection with Shu-Korath and Shu-Dereth, doesn’t seem to fit the linguistic styles of Aonic or Fjordell.  This is an intentional reference to the Jindoeese commonality of their origin.)
<br/><br/>	The central tenet of Keseg’s teachings was unity, and his followers began to squabble about what he meant by ‘Unity.’  Hence we have the loving, inclusive Korathi; the aggressive, expansionist Derethi; and the contemplative, didactic Jindoeese.  
<br/><br/>	Of course, Jesker and the Mysteries are a completely different religious line.  We’ll get more into them later. . . .
